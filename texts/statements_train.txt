I ask a lot of questions in class
I attend a pottery class
I am excited to spend a Wednesday night out with friends
I believe a full moon can cause strange behavior
I browse videos on YouTube
I buy clothes that never end up being worn
I care a lot about having a job that pays well
I care about fashion
I change the ringtone on my cellular phone
I chat with a Nobel Peace Prize winner over dinner
